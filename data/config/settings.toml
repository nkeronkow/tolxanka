#           settings.toml - General Tolxanka config file.
#
#   This is the main configuration file for the Tolxanka image board. The file
# itself is in the toml (https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) configuration
# format. All duration strings are in the format accepted by golang's
# time.ParseDuration() function (http://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).
#
#   All toml files in the config/ directory are concatenated together by
# Tolxanka and read. You may split apart or rename this file as you like.
# You may not delete any option outright; Tolxanka does not currenty guarantee
# sane defaults for all options and defaults to golang's zero values for
# undefined settings. Any changes to configuration files require a restart of
# the board to take effect.
